Write a program using C#, or the language of your choice, that returns a list of numbers from 1 to 100. Where a number is a multiple of 3, output “multiple of 3” and where the number ends in a 6, output “ends in 6”. Where the number is both a multiple of 3 and ends in 6, out “multiple of 3, ends in 6”. 
Only standard functions of the language can be used. Credit will be given for extensible, testable code.

Using the HTML below, write a program that inserts a grid in the div, generated from the data in the string. The grid should display only those records with an account number beginning with ‘B’ and should be sorted by account number.   
Values in the grid should be formatted using the rules below:
•	Numeric values formatted as 0.00
•	Date values formatted as 01 January 2019
•	Values less than 100 should have a red background
•	Values greater than 500 should have a green background.
You may use whichever tools and JavaScript frameworks you prefer to complete this task. Credit will be given for extensible, testable code.
